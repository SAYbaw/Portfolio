# My thoughts on Computer Science Education
Computer Science has become an integral part of modern society, and it is no longer limited to tech professionals. I can say that in my 20 years of working in show business, my computer science skills served me more, than my theatre skills. CS has a profound impact on our daily lives, from smartphones to the Internet of Things (IoT). The need to teach computer science in K-12 education is more crucial now than ever before. 

The job market is becoming increasingly digital, and computer science skills are in high demand. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 11.5 % from 2019 to 2029, three times faster than the average for all occupations. Thus, teaching computer science in K-12 education will equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in the job market. 

Moreover, computer science teaches students essential problem-solving skills that they can use throughout their lives. Programming requires critical thinking, creativity, and logical reasoning. When students learn to program, they learn to break down problems into smaller, manageable parts and solve them systematically. These skills can be applied to any field, from engineering to medicine to finance and even… yes… show business.

Teaching computer science in K-12 education can also help bridge the gender gap in STEM fields. Women are underrepresented in computer science, and one reason for this is that girls are not exposed to computer science early enough. By teaching computer science in K-12 education, we can encourage girls to pursue careers in STEM fields and help close the gender gap. This is something that is very important to me. Not only as a father to a young girl but as someone who is well-versed in the history of computers, I have seen the amazing impact that women have had on this field and I want to tell their stories.

Furthermore, teaching computer science in K-12 education can also help promote innovation and creativity. Students who learn to program can develop their own software and applications and use technology to solve real-world problems. For example, students can program a website that promotes environmental awareness or an app that helps people with disabilities navigate public spaces. We can foster a culture of entrepreneurship and problem-solving by giving students the tools to innovate and create. 

Finally, teaching computer science in K-12 education can also help prepare students for a future that is becoming increasingly digital. Technology is shaping every aspect of our lives, and it is essential that students understand how it works and how to use it. Teaching computer science in K-12 education will help prepare students for a world that is rapidly changing and evolving. By providing students with a strong foundation in computer science, we can help them succeed in school, their careers, and life.
